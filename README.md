<h1>Weather App Spirited</h1>
<p>Supposedly, this website was supposed to integrating my knowledge of APIs into a website that tells the user whether the weather conditions are right for a spirited drive dependent on location but time and wanting to move onto something more complicated got to me. However if I put a few more hours into this I can complete it</p>

<h2>Learned & Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Promises, using fetch, await, thenable objects, API keys and asynchronous functions.</li>
  <li>Dynamic imports for images, knowledge of dynamic imports for functions dependent on conditions</li>
</ul>

<h2>To-Do for Full Project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Notify user whether conditions are good (function already pretty much written out).</li>
  <li>Car esc styling, dashboard lit up when conditions good or brake lights on car.</li>
  <li>Modulising functions into seperate files and importing, make it easier to read, SOLID principles.</li>
  <li>Fixing time dependent on location, (another API)</li>
</ul>
